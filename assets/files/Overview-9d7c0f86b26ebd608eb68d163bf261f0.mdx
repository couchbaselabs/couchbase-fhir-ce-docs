# Overview

User management supports two UI-accessible roles: **admin** and **developer**. Patient and Practitioner roles may exist for sample data/testing but cannot log into the Admin UI.

### 1. User Roles

| Role             | UI Access         | Scopes                   | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **admin**        | ✅ Full Access    | `user/*.*`, `system/*.*` | Full control - Dashboard, Buckets, FHIR Resources, Users, Tokens, Client Registration, Logs |
| **developer**    | ✅ Limited Access | `user/*.*`               | Limited access - Only Tokens and Client Registration pages                                  |
| **patient**      | ❌ No Access      | Testing scopes           | Created during sample data load for SMART app testing only                                  |
| **practitioner** | ❌ No Access      | Testing scopes           | Created during sample data load for SMART app testing only                                  |

### 2. Authentication

- Local authentication only (no social auth)
- Passwords stored securely using BCrypt
- Login attempts from patient/practitioner roles are rejected (HTTP 403)

### 3. Scope Management

- Scopes are automatically assigned by the backend based on role
- No manual scope selection in the UI during user creation
- Admin → `["user/*.*", "system/*.*"]`
- Developer → `["user/*.*"]`
- Scopes auto-populate when generating tokens

### 4. Role-Based UI Navigation

Admin sees:

- Dashboard
- Buckets
- FHIR Resources
- Users
- API Tokens
- Client Registration
- Audit Logs
- System Logs

Developer sees:

- API Tokens
- Client Registration

**Developer redirect:** Upon login, developers are automatically redirected to `/tokens` page instead of dashboard.

### User Creation

- Create admin or developer users with email/password
- Scopes are not shown in UI (assigned automatically)
- Role dropdown shows only admin/developer options

### Login Flow

- Admin logs in and sees full navigation
- Developer logs in and is redirected to `/tokens`
- Patient/Practitioner cannot log in (HTTP 403)
- Unauthorized roles show an error message

### Navigation

- Admin sees all menu items
- Developer sees only Tokens and Client Registration
- Developer cannot access Dashboard, Buckets, FHIR Resources, Logs
- Users page is disabled (grayed out) for developers

### Password Management

- Change password from the Admin UI (avatar → Change Password)
- Initial admin credentials come from `config.yaml` on first run; after initialization, the admin user is persisted in Couchbase
- For steps, see [docs/Admin UI/Admin - Initial.mdx](docs/Admin%20UI/Admin%20-%20Initial.mdx) and [docs/Admin UI/Admin - Dashboard.mdx](docs/Admin%20UI/Admin%20-%20Dashboard.mdx)

### Scopes & Roles (Primer)

- Roles imply scopes; users do not manually select scopes
- Admin scopes: `user/*.*`, `system/*.*`
- Developer scopes: `user/*.*`
- Detailed token behavior, grants, and flows are covered in the OAuth/Tokens guide

### Notes

- Validation behavior (mode/profile) is configured at the bucket level. See [docs/Install Couchbase FHIR Server/Validation.md](docs/Install%20Couchbase%20FHIR%20Server/Validation.md)
- To issue API tokens or register clients, use the Tokens/Client Registration pages and refer to the OAuth/Tokens documentation (separate)
