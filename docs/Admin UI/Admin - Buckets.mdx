Now that you have a FHIR bucket, let’s explore the Buckets view. We’ll look at Collections, load a sample dataset, and review the FTS Indexes that power search.

:::info What you’ll do

- Navigate Collections and read key metrics
- Load the US Core sample dataset
- Inspect the automatically created FTS Indexes
  :::

## Collections

The Buckets view opens on the Collections tab. In the top-right, there’s a selector to choose which FHIR bucket to view. If you have only one, it’s selected by default.

The Collections table lists all FHIR resource collections for the bucket, along with document counts.

:::note Hidden system collections
The table doesn’t show the internal system collections (e.g., Versions and Tombstones). On a new FHIR bucket, document counts are 0.
:::

Next to the table, the Metrics panel summarizes Couchbase Server metrics for this bucket:

- **System**: CPU and Free RAM
- **Cache Performance**: Resident Ratio and Cache Miss Ratio
- **Operations/sec**: Total, GETs, and SETs
- **Search**: Queries, Rejected, and Blocked (rates)

All of these come directly from Couchbase Server.

## Samples

Open the Samples tab to load a small dataset.

<img src={ImgSamples} alt="Available sample datasets: Synthea and US Core" />

You’ll see two sample dataset cards: **Synthea** and **US Core**. Since this bucket uses the US Core profile, load the US Core sample. Data is written into the currently selected bucket.

  alt="Load US Core sample data into the selected bucket"
/>

Loading takes only a few seconds. Return to the Collections tab and you’ll see document counts populated across collections.

  alt="Collections populated after loading sample data"
/>

:::tip Sample data scope
These datasets are intentionally small so you can quickly verify end-to-end behavior. For larger or custom datasets, use your own import pipelines.

## FTS Indexes

Open the FTS Indexes tab to see the search indexes created for your FHIR bucket.

<img src={ImgFtsIndexes} alt="List of FTS indexes for the FHIR bucket" />

When you convert a bucket to FHIR, the system automatically creates the required FTS indexes. This view lists those indexes and shows the number of documents indexed. Selecting an index opens a details panel on the right with multiple tabs:

- **JSON**: the index definition in JSON
- **Tree View**: a hierarchical view of field mappings
- **Metrics**: real-time index performance and health indicators

Tree View example:

<img src={ImgTreeView} width="400" alt="FTS index definition in Tree View" />

Metrics example:

<img src={ImgMetricsView} width="400" alt="FTS index metrics" />

Key metrics include:

- **Search Query Rate**: overall search rate and error rate
- **Average Latency** (ms)
- **Document Count** indexed
- **Indexing Queue**: Mutations Remaining and Docs Remaining

All metrics are sourced from Couchbase Server’s FTS engine.
