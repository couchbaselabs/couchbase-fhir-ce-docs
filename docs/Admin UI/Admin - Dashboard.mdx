# Dashboard

## Layout

<img src={ImgDashboard} alt="Admin UI Dashboard" />

Let's take a tour of the Dashboard.

## Appbar

Shows high-level Couchbase and FHIR server status and provides quick actions:

- Connection indicators (Couchbase connection, bucket readiness, FHIR initialization)
- Notifications
- Theme toggle (light/dark)
- Help and Feedback
- User menu (avatar): Profile, Change Password, Sign out

## Navbar

Left-side navigation for common areas:

- Dashboard (current)
- Buckets — manage the FHIR bucket and indexes. See [docs/Admin UI/Admin - Buckets.mdx](docs/Admin%20UI/Admin%20-%20Buckets.mdx)
- Resources — browse and manage FHIR resources. See [docs/Admin UI/Admin - Resources.mdx](docs/Admin%20UI/Admin%20-%20Resources.mdx)
- Validation — mode/profile overview. See [docs/Install Couchbase FHIR Server/Validation.md](docs/Install%20Couchbase%20FHIR%20Server/Validation.md)
- Users, API Tokens, Client Registration, Logs (available depending on setup)

## Main Panel

### Couchbase Server

Shows Couchbase cluster information and bucket metrics:

- Cluster nodes and health
- Target bucket: name (`fhir`), memory/resident ratio
- Basic metrics (ops/sec, disk usage, item count)
- Index status (FTS/GSI)

### FHIR Server & Load Balancer

System and traffic charts:

- CPU and memory usage
- Operations throughput and concurrency
- Latency percentiles (e.g., P50/P95)
- JVM heap, GC activity, metaspace/buffers
- Load balancer request rate and error counts (4xx/5xx)

Charts update periodically to reflect live activity.

## Quick Actions

- Change admin password: Avatar → Change password
- Open Buckets: Manage scopes/collections and indexes
- View Logs: Tail application logs for troubleshooting

## Tips

:::tip
If charts appear empty, verify the Couchbase connection and that the FHIR bucket is initialized.

:::note
Configuration changes (memory, logging, baseUrl, TLS) should be made in `config.yaml` and applied with `./scripts/apply-config.sh`. See the install docs for details.
