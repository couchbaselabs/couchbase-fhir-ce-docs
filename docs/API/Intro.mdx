# Couchbase FHIR API Overview

Couchbase FHIR CE provides a standards-compliant FHIR R4 REST API for managing healthcare data as JSON resources.
The API implements the official FHIR RESTful pattern defined by HL7 and supports full CRUD + Search operations across all FHIR resource types.

## Base URL

All API endpoints follow a tenant-aware base path:

```
http://<host>/fhir/<bucket>/
```

- **host** — The hostname or IP address where the FHIR server is running.
  Example: localhost, an EC2 public DNS, or a Capella endpoint.
- **bucket** — The Couchbase bucket name representing the tenant.
  Every tenant is fully isolated with its own data, validation settings, and indexes.
  _This parameter is required for all requests, including metadata endpoints like CapabilityStatement._

### Example:

```
http://localhost/fhir/acme/
```

All FHIR operations under this path target the acme tenant.

:::tip Buckets and Tenants
Each bucket is a FHIR store. Switching the bucket switches the dataset and configuration.

## Tools

You can interact with the API using any REST client, including:

- Postman
- Insomnia
- curl (used throughout this documentation)

### Example

```
curl 'http://localhost/fhir/acme/Patient?name=Baxter'
```

This example performs a FHIR search for Patient resources whose name includes “Baxter” within the acme tenant.

## Specification Compliance

Couchbase FHIR CE implements the FHIR R4 RESTful API and supports all core CRUD and Search operations defined by HL7.

### FHIR-compliant endpoints and behavior

- Resource types follow the R4 specification.
- REST operations conform to the official FHIR RESTful interactions:
  - POST – Create
  - GET – Read and Search
  - PUT – Update
  - DELETE – Soft Delete
  - PATCH – Partial Update (JSON Merge Patch)

### Search Parameters

- All standard FHIR R4 search parameters are supported unless explicitly noted.
- Advanced features such as \_include, \_revinclude, \_count, \_sort, and \_elements are available.
- Search is powered by Couchbase FTS (Full Text Search) for high performance.

### Profiles and Extensions

If the bucket is configured with a US Core profile, additional US Core Search parameters are automatically enabled.

## Supported Operations

| Operation             | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create (`POST`)**   | Add new FHIR resources                                |
| **Read (`GET`)**      | Retrieve individual resources by ID                   |
| **Update (`PUT`)**    | Replace existing resources                            |
| **Delete (`DELETE`)** | Soft-delete resources (tombstone retained)            |
| **Patch (`PATCH`)**   | Apply partial updates using JSON Merge Patch          |
| **Search (`GET`)**    | Query resources with FHIR-compliant search parameters |

All operations return standard FHIR response bundles with proper OperationOutcome resources for errors and validation messages.

## Compliance and Scope

FHIR Version: R4
REST Interactions: Full CRUD + Search
Resources: All R4 resource types, stored as native JSON
Search: FHIR-compliant, powered by Couchbase FTS
Validation: Optional; configurable per tenant
Profiles: Base FHIR R4 or US Core 6.1.0 (per bucket)

## Current Beta Limitations

The current beta release focuses on core functionality and performance.

- TLS / HTTPS — Not yet supported.
- All endpoints run over HTTP during this phase.
- Authentication / Authorization — Not yet implemented.
  - Future versions will support security layers (e.g., SMART on FHIR, OAuth2).

## Summary

Couchbase FHIR CE offers a FHIR R4-compliant REST API with:
Full CRUD + Search support
Standards-based responses
Tenant-aware routing via `/fhir/<bucket>/`
Optional profile-based validation and search extensions (e.g., US Core)

This API serves as a reliable and scalable interface for storing, retrieving, and querying FHIR data directly in Couchbase — leveraging native JSON storage, fast KV access, and powerful FTS-based search.
