# Search Pagination

Couchbase FHIR CE paginates search results (including queries that use \_include/\_revinclude) and returns a Bundle with type: "searchset". You control page size with \_count; the server returns a next link while more results remain.

### Example

#### Request

```
GET http://localhost/fhir/acme/fhir/<bucket>/Patient?identifier=http://hospital.smarthealthit.org%7C1032702&_revinclude=Observation:subject&_count=20
```

#### Response (200 OK) — abbreviated:

## Defaults & Limits

- Default page size: 50 (if \_count omitted).
- Hard cap per request: up to 1000 resources (combined primary + includes) returned across all pages.
- Below this cap, total is accurate.
- For \_revinclude, if 50 primaries match, the secondary (included) budget is 1000 − 50 = 950 for that request.

We’ll cover general paging here; details of \_include/\_revinclude behavior are on their respective pages. This page does not dive into spec pagination nuances beyond what you need to use it.

## How Paging Works (Server Flow)

### Key discovery (FTS)

- The server runs the search with an internal limit of 1000 and collects all matching primary keys.
- If \_revinclude/\_include is present, it collects secondary keys within the remaining budget (e.g., 950).

### Key buffer

- All keys (primary first, then includes) are deduplicated and stored in a buffer.
- Small result sets
  - If the buffer size ≤ \_count (or default 50), the server batch-fetches via KV and returns a single page.
- Large result sets

  - The server creates a pagination state object:
    - id = UUID (returned as \_page)
    - offset = starting index into the buffered keys (returned as \_offset)
    - size = \_count (fixed for the life of the cursor)
    - TTL = 15 minutes

- It returns the first page and a next link:

```
...?_page=<UUID>&_offset=<nextOffset>&_count=<size>
```

### Subsequent pages

Each follow-up request uses the \_page token; the server resumes from offset, fetches the next slice of keys, and advances offset until exhausted.

- Completion / expiry
  - When all pages are served, no next link is returned.
- If the cursor expires (15 min idle), the server returns an OperationOutcome with a paging-token error; simply re-run the original search.
- Isolation: Results are read-committed; no partial/dirty reads. FTS reflects committed state; KV fetches the current committed versions at response time.

### What Gets Paged?

- Primary results are paged by \_count.
- For queries with \_revinclude / \_include, included resources correspond to the primaries on that page.
- Primary results may be sorted via \_sort. Included resources are appended (not globally interleaved with sorted primaries).

### Links

- **self**: Echoes the current request (host and path preserved).
- **next**: Contains \_page, \_offset, and \_count parameters.

### Totals

- total reports the number of primary matches.
- With the 1000-resource cap, totals are accurate when the complete primary keyset fits under the cap.
- You can also control total computation using \_total=accurate|estimate|none (defaults to accurate under cap).

## Best Practices

- Use reasonable \_count values (e.g., 20–100) for best UX and throughput.
- Prefer identifier filters to keep primary sets small and predictable.
- Keep include lists minimal; fetch only what you’ll render.
- If a next link is present, follow it exactly (don’t reconstruct parameters).

## Error Cases

- Expired \_page token (15 min TTL): returns an OperationOutcome—rerun the original search.
- Invalid \_page or \_offset: OperationOutcome with processing error.
- Exceeded cap: The server may truncate includes and add an OperationOutcome warning; primaries remain correct.

## Summary

- Default 50 per page; cap 1000 resources total (primary + includes).
- Two-phase FTS → buffered keys → batched KV fetch.
- Cursor state via \_page + \_offset, 15-minute TTL.
- total reflects primary matches; includes are per-page companions.
- Accurate, fast, and consistent paging semantics built on FTS + KV.
