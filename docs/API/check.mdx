# Checkpoint after Updates

In the previous steps:

- Created document Patient/1234 with PUT
- Updated that document with telecom using PUT
- Patched that document with deceasedDataTime with PATCH

So, let's now examine this FHIR resource

## Admin UI FHIR Resource View

### View versions

<img src={ImgCheckpoint} alt="ImgCheckpoint" />
This pic shows the 3 versions of the document Patient/1234

### Select versions to compare

<img src={ImgCompare1} alt="ImgCompare1" />
Let's select versions 2 and 3 for comparison. Click Compare button

### Blame view

<img src={ImgCompare2} alt="ImgCompare2" />
This pic shows the difference, like github blame.
