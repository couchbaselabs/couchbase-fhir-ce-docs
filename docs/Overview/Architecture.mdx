# System Architecture

Couchbase FHIR CE is a **modular, containerized platform** built for performance, scalability, and interoperability.

It consists of **three core containers**, each with a dedicated role in the system:

- **FHIR Server** – REST API, validation, persistence
- **FHIR Admin** – Frontend dashboard & management UI
- **HAProxy** – Smart load balancer, multi-tenant router, and metrics gateway

Together, they form a complete FHIR platform that connects seamlessly to **Couchbase Server** or **Capella**.

---

## High-Level Architecture

<img src={ImgArchitecture} alt="Architecture" />

## Core building blocks:

- One or more **Couchbase clusters** (Self‑Managed or Capella)
- **FHIR Server** container (Spring Boot + HAPI FHIR)
- **Admin UI** container (React + MUI)
- **HAProxy** container (routing and metrics)
- Optional: synthetic data generators, monitoring/observability stack

---

## Component Breakdown

### FHIR Server (`fhir-server`)

The **core of the platform**. Implements the FHIR RESTful API.

- Built with **Spring Boot** and **HAPI FHIR**
- Supports **FHIR R4** and **US Core Implementation Guide (IG)**
- Handles CRUD, search, validation, and transaction bundles
- Integrates with **Couchbase SDK** for data access
- Supports:
  - `_include`, `_revinclude`, `$everything`
  - Pagination and sorting
  - US Core validation via HAPI’s validator + NPM packages
- Stores all resources as **native JSON documents** in Couchbase

**Multi-Tenancy:**

- Each **Couchbase bucket** represents one **tenant**
- Buckets are isolated by configuration and routing
- Validation and search behaviors can differ per tenant

**Observability:**

- Metrics via **Micrometer + Spring Actuator**
- Exposes `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/prometheus`

---

### FHIR Admin (`fhir-admin`)

A **React-based management dashboard** for administrators and developers.

- Built with **React 19**, **MUI**, **Zustand**, **React Query**, and **Recharts**
- Provides:
  - Real-time **cluster metrics** (CPU, memory, disk)
  - **FTS index** browser and status viewer
  - **Query dashboards** for testing and benchmarking
  - **Validation logs** and **tenant configuration**
- Communicates with backend APIs for metrics and management

**Features:**

- Light/Dark theme
- Monaco JSON editor
- Time-based dashboards with minute/hour/day sampling
- HAProxy and FHIR metrics visualization

---

### HAProxy (`haproxy`)

A lightweight, high-performance **load balancer and router**.

- Routes incoming FHIR REST calls to the correct **tenant bucket**
- Can route by **path prefix** (e.g., `/fhir/{tenant}/...`)
- Collects request-level metrics:
  - Active connections, response times, ops/sec
- Supports:
  - SSL/TLS termination (optional)
  - Multi-node scaling
- Can be replaced by other gateways (NGINX, Kong) in advanced setups

---

### Couchbase Server / Capella

The underlying **data platform**.

- Stores all **FHIR resources** as JSON documents
- Organizes data by **bucket / scope / collection**
- Uses **Full Text Search (FTS)** indexes for query
- Provides **KV, N1QL, FTS APIs**
- Offers **horizontal scalability** and **high availability**
- Works on-prem (self-managed) or cloud (Capella)

---

## Data Flow

```text
[Client / App]
   ↓
  [HAProxy]
   ↓
 [FHIR Server] ⇆ [Couchbase Cluster]
   ↑
 [FHIR Admin Dashboard]
```

Request lifecycle (example: `GET /fhir/acme/Patient?name=John`):

1. HAProxy routes the request to FHIR Server with tenant context `bucket=acme`.
2. FHIR Server parses search params (HAPI FHIR) and builds an **FTS query**.
3. Couchbase **FTS** returns matching document IDs.
4. Couchbase **KV** fetches full JSON resources by ID (batched).
5. FHIR Server assembles and returns a **FHIR Bundle** response.
6. Admin UI polls metrics/logs from FHIR Server and HAProxy for observability.

Notes:

- FTS handles query semantics; KV guarantees low‑latency retrieval.
- Pagination can reuse cached ID sets to avoid repeated FTS cost.

## Deployment Model

Couchbase FHIR CE is fully containerized and can run anywhere:

- Developer machines via `docker-compose`
- Cloud VMs (for example, AWS EC2) connecting to Couchbase Server
- Capella (managed Couchbase) with FHIR services deployed in your environment
- On‑prem Kubernetes or VM clusters

Typical `docker-compose` stack includes:

- `fhir-server`
- `fhir-admin`
- `haproxy`

Optional add‑ons: Inferno validator, Redis (caching), Prometheus/Grafana (monitoring).

## Architecture Principles

| Principle    | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| JSON‑native  | Store FHIR resources as‑is; no transformation layer |
| Composable   | Each service can be replaced independently          |
| Observable   | Metrics everywhere: server, HAProxy, Couchbase      |
| Scalable     | Horizontal scale via buckets, nodes, partitions     |
| Multi‑tenant | Buckets isolate tenants; per‑tenant configuration   |
| Secure       | TLS‑ready; authentication/authorization pluggable   |

## Operational Considerations

- Scalability: Scale out by adding Couchbase nodes, partitioning FTS indexes, and horizontally scaling `fhir-server` pods/containers.
- Security: Enable TLS end‑to‑end; restrict ingress via HAProxy; use least‑privilege DB credentials; isolate tenants per bucket.
- Observability: Expose Prometheus metrics from FHIR Server and HAProxy; visualize with Grafana; enable structured logs.
- Resilience: Run multiple `fhir-server` instances behind HAProxy; configure health checks; set sensible timeouts and retries.

## Summary

The modular design of Couchbase FHIR CE lets you:

- Deploy quickly with containers
- Scale predictably across tenants and data volume
- Operate with rich metrics and clear separation of concerns
- Achieve low‑latency, standards‑compliant FHIR operations via KV + FTS

## Next Steps

- Understand how resources map to collections: [FHIR Resources on Couchbase](./FHIR%20Resources.md)
- Learn how search is implemented: [Indexing Strategy (FTS)](./FTS%20Index.md)
